## HexCalculator
**Assignment 1 - Question1**

Design a class HexCalc that supports following methods for hexadecimal arithmetic. You can assume that this class will be working with only positive integers.

  * Methods to add, subtract, multiply and divide two hexadecimal numbers. Each of the methods will receive hexadecimal numbers as strings, and will return the computed value as      hexadecimal string. The strategy that can be followed by each of the methods is to convert the strings into numbers, perform the computation, and reconvert the result back        into hexadecimal representation.

  * Methods to compare two hexadecimal numbers for ==, > and <. Each of these methods will return a boolean value. Implement these methods without converting the arguments to          decimal numbers for comparison.

  * Return the decimal representation of hexadecimal number.

  * Return the hexadecimal representation of decimal number.

How would you generalise this to support arithmetic in any base?


## JobScheduler
#### Assignment 1 - Question 2

Design a class JobScheduler to simulate FCFS (First Come First Serve) scheduling algorithm. 
FCFS means the process which arrives first, gets executed first. 

Assume that we are receiving a number of processes with their arrival time and burst time seconds in a two dimensional array as input.  For example:

[0][10] 
[6][20] 
[60][10] 
[110][5] 

Define methods to perform following operations: 

* Calculate completion time for each process. 
* Calculate waiting time for each process.
* Calculate turn around time for each process.
* Average waiting time of processes.
* Maximum waiting time period for a process in queue.
